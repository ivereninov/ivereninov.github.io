## Intro
The program is designed to calculate the gradients of monovalent ions on the plasma membrane of
animal cells, which play a key role in intra- and intercellular signaling, transmembrane transport of
substances, and cell water balance. These gradients are considered as a consequence of the presence in
the cell of negatively charged polyelectrolytes and 5 types of mechanisms responsible for the movement
of monovalent ions through the membrane (pump, channels, cotransporters).
 
 The physical and mathematical foundations for calculating flux balance equations, as well as the notation of variables and
parameters, and the use of the program for analyzing real experimental data are described in open
publications (Vereninov et al., 2014, 2016; Yurinskaya et al., 2019, 2020; Yurinskaya, Vereninov,
2021, 2022). 

 The minimum set of "input" experimental data is necessary to find the characteristic parameters of the
cell's electrochemical system for further calculation of unidirectional fluxes of all monovalent ions along
each of the ion pathways, electrochemical gradients of all ions on the cell membrane under the
balanced state and during transient processes caused by a change in the composition of the medium or
characteristic parameters
